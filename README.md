This is an ideabox exercise

- On the landing page, users may register or log in 
- Once logged in, users may : 
  *submit a new idea
  *see the ideas posted by other users : 
        - upvote or downvote an idea
        - filter by popularity : from most to less popular 
        - filter by date : from most recent to oldest
- Admins may :
  *see all the ideas submitted by users
  *filter by popularity : from less to most popular (allowing them to delete the less popular ideas more easily)
  *delete ideas 
  
  
  Additional improvements TBD : 
   - check if user has already upvoted/downvoted an idea : prevent him/her for voting multiple times for the same idea
   - allow admin to manage users 
   - wait for admin moderation & approval before an idea is posted for everyone to see
